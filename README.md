# 2D Laminar Viscous-Inviscid Interaction Solver using Thwaites Method

This code is a part of final project of AE 5012 Viscous Flow Major, in Aerospace Engineering ITB. Currently, the program
is only capable of solving the laminar part of the flow.

# How to use: 

1. Place the desired airfoil coordinate and the Javafoil or any other references result in the same folder with the code. The naming of the
airfoil and reference result must follow examples given in the Example_data folder (The format must also in CSV). 

3. Change the airfoil name inside the code. 

2. Run the code and enjoy the results.
